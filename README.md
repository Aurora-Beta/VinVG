# VinVG is not VerkehrsGigant

My first try at programming a game by reprogramming an rather old traffic management game called "TrafficGiant" or on German "VerkehrsGigant".
This project is in pure prototype stage as i barely started to create and learn things on my own.

## What i've done so far:
  - Layed the foundation for a 2.5d engine consists entirely on Python 3 and pygame
    - 2.5d-engine can scroll over a given map with multiple layers of sprites
  - Created some rather spooky sprites
  - Map-reader
  - Some experiments with graphs, passengers and game logic
  - Created a GitHub-account and this project :^)

## What needs to be done:
  - A whole lot of game logic:
    - Cross roads
    - Collision detection
    - Passengers

  - Game engine:
    - Multiple layers of graphs
    - Mouse handling
    - Buttons and menus
    - Graphics
    - Sprites movement
    - Zooming
    - Key bindings
    - ...

  - Designing
    - Levels
    - Maps
    - Sprites

## Requirements to run
  - Python3
  - pygame compiled for python3

## How to run?

Simply execute:
```shell
python3 main.py
```

Any one can contribute if they're willing to - i'm very happy and eager to learn new stuff :-)
