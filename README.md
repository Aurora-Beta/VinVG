# VinVG is not VerkehrsGigant

My first try at programming a game by reprogramming an rather old traffic management game called "TrafficGiant" or on German "VerkehrsGigant".
This project is in pure prototype stage as i barely started to learn things on my own.

## What i've done so far:
  - Layed the foundation for a 2.5d engine consists entirely on Python 3 and pygame
    - 2.5d-engine can scroll over a given map with multiple layers of sprites
  - Created some rather spooky sprites
  - Map-reader
  - Some experiments with graphs, passengers and game logic
  - Created a GitHub-account and this project :^)

## What needs to be done:
  - A whole lot of logic:
    - cross roads
    - sprites movement
    - multiple layers of graphs
    - collision detection
    - mouse handling
    - buttons
    - graphics
    - ...

## Requirements to run

  - Python3
  - pygame compiled for Python3

## How to run?

Simply execute:
python3 main.py


Any one can contribute if they're willing to - i'm very happy and eager to learn new stuff :-)
